## Professional Experience

Working as a Library Front Desk Aide at my college's library, DeWitt Wallace Library, has been my first professional experience. I'm grateful for the chance I have to be in such a fun and supportive community where I get to learn new valuable skills such as customer service, independence and team-work.

Alongside that, I volunteer every week at 826 MSP as an After-School Creative Lab tutor. This experience with K-12 BIPOC children allows me to foster an engaging learning environment using active listening and collective responsibility. Community engagement has always been important for me ever seen I grew up amidst the creation of my mother's association, SMEG (Solidarity to the Mothers and Children of Guinea), which helps those back in our country of origin. I helped with selling African goods in flea markets for fundraising, distributing flyers to promote donations, and sorting through donated items such as clothes, children's books, and non-perishable food to be prepared for shipping.

My numerous responsibility roles babysitting my nieces, contributing to local food banks and associations stem from my goal to be an actor in society. In my future career, I want to combine this mission with technology and potentially linguistics to meet the needs of the people. I am open to any internship in software engineering/web development/startup opportunities.

## My Journey from Paris to Minnesota

## <img src="images/macalester.jpg" alt="Me in front of my college" class="img-styling" width="70%"/>

I was born and grew up in France in the suburbs of Paris where I was raised in a Guinean household with four siblings. Coming from an underprivileged neighborhood with non-graduate parents, it became my ambition to combat social inequalities by developing my passion for education and technology and realizing the impact I can have on the world.

In 10th grade, during my time at the French public high school Lycée Polyvalent Eugène Ionesco, I was introduced to [United World Colleges (UWC)](https://www.uwc.org/), and after a long selection process, I left for UWC Maastricht, an international high school in the Netherlands that shapes future dreamers and changemakers ready to have an impact on the world of tomorrow. The full scholarship of €58,000 offered me the opportunity to access a unique education, the International Baccalaureate, surrounded by people from over a hundred different nationalities. This two-year experience encouraged me to take multiple initiatives: I contributed to campus life with Spirit Team; discussed the impacts of colonialism by leading the Decolonise Club; offered a learning environment to students through the Coding Club; created an entrepreneurial project to deconstruct beauty standards with Project Beauty, and much more. I am constantly learning from others and am fortunate to develop my passions while exploring new ones. I am grateful to have been able to take these initiatives while focusing on my studies and fully enjoying my UWC experience.

Thanks to these experiences, I was accepted into a recognized liberal arts college in the US, Macalester College, where I have the opportunity to continue exploring my passions and developing my skills on a daily basis. Pursuing a degree in Computer Science at Macalester College to become a software engineer will give me the opportunity to have a positive impact and to be able, later on, to give the same opportunities to young people from a similar background, following the support I received throughout my life.

## Quick Facts About Me

1.  I love football (soccer)! I've been playing for over 9 years now with various teams including men's teams, D3 teams, Dutch teams, adult teams, varsity teams or even futsal teams.

2.  I started programming in middle school with Scratch to familiarize myself with problem solving and pseudocode and later on in high school, I took advantage of the free online resources available to me to further my learning (Codeacademy, Harvard CS50x, Coursera, freeCodeCamp, YouTube etc).

3.  Outside of football, I read a lot of books (love the fictional ones!), lift, romanticize life, cook, bake and play video games. One thing I would love to try though is knitting!

4.  I speak four languages; French, Jakhanke (ethnic language), English, Spanish; and I'm currently learning Indonesian and Arabic.

5.  I'm 18 years old. Born in October, 2005 in France. I now live in St. Paul Minnesota.
