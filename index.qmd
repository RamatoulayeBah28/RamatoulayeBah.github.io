### About Me

:::{#intro-heading}

I'm a rising Sophomore student at Macalester College. I plan on pursuing a Bachelor of Arts Degree in Computer Science and Linguistics with a minor in Spanish. Of French nationality and Guinean origin, I thrive to have a positive impact on my communities and I hope to use technology and the skills I foster daily as tools to achieve this goal. I'm passionate about tech, soccer, languages, social justice, and discovering new things every day! [More about me](https://ramatoulayebah28.github.io/about.html)
