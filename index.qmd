### About Me

:::{#intro-heading}

I'm currently a Freshman student at Macalester College. I plan on pursuing a Bachelor of Arts Degree with double majors in Computer Science and Linguistics. I was born and grew up in France in a Guinean household and studied at UWC Maastricht in the Netherlands for two years where I obtained my International Baccalaureate Bilingual Diploma. I'm passionate about soccer, languages, social justice, and discovering new things every day!
