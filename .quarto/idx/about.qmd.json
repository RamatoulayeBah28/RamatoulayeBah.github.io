Coming from an underprivileged neighborhood with non-graduate parents, it became my ambition to combat social inequalities by developing my passion for education and technology and realizing the impact I can have on the world.\n\nIn 10th grade, during my time at the French public high school Lycée Polyvalent Eugène Ionesco, I was introduced to [United World Colleges (UWC)](https://www.uwc.org/), and after a long selection process, I left for UWC Maastricht, an international high school in the Netherlands that shapes future dreamers and changemakers ready to have an impact on the world of tomorrow. The full scholarship of €58,000 offered me the opportunity to access a unique education, the International Baccalaureate, surrounded by people from over a hundred different nationalities. This two-year experience encouraged me to take multiple initiatives: I contributed to campus life with Spirit Team; discussed the impacts of colonialism by leading the Decolonise Club; offered a learning environment to students through the Coding Club; created an entrepreneurial project to deconstruct beauty standards with Project Beauty, and much more. I am constantly learning from others and am fortunate to develop my passions while exploring new ones. I am grateful to have been able to take these initiatives while focusing on my studies and fully enjoying my UWC experience.\n\nThanks to these experiences, I was accepted into a recognized liberal arts college in the US, Macalester College, where I have the opportunity to continue exploring my passions and developing my skills on a daily basis. Pursuing a degree in Computer Science at Macalester College to become a software engineer will give me the opportunity to have a positive impact and to be able, later on, to give the same opportunities to young people from a similar background, following the support I received throughout my life.\n\n## Quick Facts About Me\n\n1.  I love football (soccer)! I've been playing for over 9 years now with various teams including men's teams, D3 teams, Dutch teams, adult teams, varsity teams or even futsal teams.\n\n## <img src=\"images/keepermac.jpg\" alt=\"Me about to side-volley kick the ball\" class=\"img-styling\" width=\"70%\"/>\n\n2.  I started programming in middle school with Scratch to familiarize myself with problem solving and pseudocode and later on in high school, I took advantage of the free online resources available to me to further my learning (Codeacademy, Harvard CS50x, Coursera, freeCodeCamp, YouTube etc).\n\n3.  Outside of football, I read a lot of books (love the fictional ones!), lift, romanticize life, cook, bake and play video games. One thing I would love to try though is knitting!\n\n4.  I speak four languages; French, Jakhanke (ethnic language), English, Spanish; and I'm currently learning Indonesian and Arabic.\n\n5.  I'm 18 years old. Born in October, 2005 in France.
