Each correct letter of the word pops up on the screen with every correct attempt throughout the game. If the guess is incorrect, an illustration of a hangman progressively appears with every wrong attempt until the game is over.\nIllustrative Images: If a user successfully guesses the word, an image of a happy squirrel will appear on the screen. If a user does not successfully guess the correct word, an image of a sad squirrel will appear.\nDescriptive labels: In the top part of the window, a representation of the hidden word with dashes indicates that its letters have not yet been guessed, and when guessed, it will update, revealing the letter and its position. Each dash represents a hidden letter of the word. At the bottom, a label with the number of attempts for each game is located. The label updates with every attempt, decreasing from 6 to 0."

    "text": "I was born and grew up in France in the suburbs of Paris where I was raised in a Guinean household with four siblings. Coming from an underprivileged neighborhood with non-graduate parents, it became my ambition to combat social inequalities by developing my passion for education and technology and realizing the impact I can have on the world.\nIn 10th grade, during my time at the French public high school Lycée Polyvalent Eugène Ionesco, I was introduced to United World Colleges (UWC), and after a long selection process, I left for UWC Maastricht, an international high school in the Netherlands that shapes future dreamers and changemakers ready to have an impact on the world of tomorrow. The full scholarship of €58,000 offered me the opportunity to access a unique education, the International Baccalaureate, surrounded by people from over a hundred different nationalities. This two-year experience encouraged me to take multiple initiatives: I contributed to campus life with Spirit Team; discussed the impacts of colonialism by leading the Decolonise Club; offered a learning environment to students through the Coding Club; created an entrepreneurial project to deconstruct beauty standards with Project Beauty, and much more. I am constantly learning from others and am fortunate to develop my passions while exploring new ones. I am grateful to have been able to take these initiatives while focusing on my studies and fully enjoying my UWC experience.\nThanks to these experiences, I was accepted into a recognized liberal arts college in the US, Macalester College, where I have the opportunity to continue exploring my passions and developing my skills on a daily basis. Pursuing a degree in Computer Science at Macalester College to become a software engineer will give me the opportunity to have a positive impact and to be able, later on, to give the same opportunities to young people from a similar background, following the support I received throughout my life."
