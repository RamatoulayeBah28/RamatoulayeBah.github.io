An entry-level course taught by David J. Malan, CS50x teaches students how to think algorithmically and solve problems efficiently. Topics include abstraction, algorithms, data structures, encapsulation, resource management, security, software engineering, and web development. Languages include C, Python, SQL, and JavaScript plus CSS and HTML. Problem sets inspired by real-world domains of biology, cryptography, finance, forensics, and gaming. The on-campus version of CS50x , CS50, is Harvard’s largest course.\nStudents who earn a satisfactory score on 9 problem sets (i.e., programming assignments) and a final project are eligible for a certificate. This is a self-paced course–you may take CS50x on your own schedule.\nOutcomes of this course:\n\nA broad and robust understanding of computer science and programming\nHow to think algorithmically and solve programming problems efficiently\nConcepts like abstraction, algorithms, data structures, encapsulation, resource management, security, software engineering, and web development\nFamiliarity with a number of languages, including C, Python, SQL, and JavaScript plus CSS and HTML\nHow to engage with a vibrant community of like-minded learners from all levels of experience\nHow to develop and present a final programming project to your peers\nHarvard University certificate upon completion"
